# Multiline Queues and some generalizations

The following files implement the objects and maps from "Macdonald polynomials at t = 0 through (generalized) multiline queues" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05362). The multiline queues considered here are the t=0 version of the objects from "From multiline queues to Macdonald polynomials via the exclusion process" (https://muse.jhu.edu/pub/1/article/850573) where the authors introduce extra parameters to the multiline queues of Ferrari and Martin (https://www.jstor.org/stable/25449997) to make an explicit connection of multiline queues and Macdonald polynomials.

We give a quick description on how the fules are organized. 

## MultilineQueues and ExampleMLQs

In *MultilineQueues*, the class of these objects is created with the combinatorial features needed in the t=0 case. They include the definition of objects from ball arrangements, pairing and collapsing procedures, and an implementation of the RSK-esque algorithms defined on multiline queues. 
*ExamplesMLQs* contains different explicit examples and visualization of the objects and the different methods.
